        "content": "<p>A day after AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal raised an alarm over deletion of voters from the electoral roll ahead of Delhi Assembly elections, his claims seems to have backfired with one of the woman voters outrightly rejecting his assertions.</p><p>Chandra, a woman voter in Delhi's Kidwai Nagar constituency, said on record that she has been casting her ballot every year and her name was mistakenly taken by Arvind Kejriwal.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to IANS, she said, \"I have never had my vote cut. I always cast my vote. I don't know why they mistakenly said that my name was removed from the list. I already have my voter ID card, there is no need to make a new one. It could have been a misunderstanding on Kejriwal's part otherwise, I have been casting my vote every time.\"</p><p>Her husband Raghu also countered Mr Kejriwal's claims on her wife's name being struck off the electoral rolls, ahead of elections and said, \u201cIt is possible that he (Arvind Kejriwal) mistakenly mentioned someone else's name and referred to us. Our vote has not been cancelled.\"</p><p>It was during the launch of Mahila Samman Yojana that former Delhi Chief Minister claimed that Chandra's name was removed from the electoral rolls, apparently as part of BJP's plot and his party would get her name reinstated in the list.</p><p>The AAP supremo visited the constituency on Monday, to kickstart the process of registration for \u2018Mahila Samman Yojana', under which he has pledged Rs 2,100 monthly financial assistance for women residents of the city, if party returns to power.</p><p>While naming Chandra as the 'victim' of voters list name deletion drive, carried out by BJP, he said that his partymen will ensure that they don't get deprived of their basic rights to vote.</p><p>He also shared a video of the registration drive and said that this \u2018conspiracy' by BJP will impair chances of city's women residents from getting Rs 2,100, as promised under Mahila Samman Yojana.</p><p>Taking to X, he wrote, \u201cWhen we went to start the registration for 'Mahila Samman Yojana', a sister told me that someone had got her vote cancelled. We will get her vote made again. But I want to tell all my mothers and sisters of Delhi that all of you should check your vote. It is necessary to have your name in the voter list to get Rs 2100 every month.\u201d</p><p>As the city prepares for election, the AAP and BJP have raised the stakes for a high-pitched electoral battle. BJP has been trying to corner the AAP dispensation over the Rohingya issue, fraudulent liquor policy and others while the latter has accused it of orchestrating a widespread voter deletion drive to target its voter base.</p><p>AAP has alleged that BJP has been pushing for removal of many voters, mostly its supporters, from the electoral list and submitting applications regarding the same to the Election Commission.</p><p>\u201cIn Shahdara area, BJP has sought removal of over 11,000 voters. After cross-checking, we found that 500 of these voters still live in that locality,\u201d Kejriwal said in a recent public address.</p><p></p>"

When a competitive democracy becomes deeply polarised, to the extent that civil discourse is replaced by bitterness, abuse and mistrust, legislation of any kind becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible. At this point in time, the planned law on One Nation, One Election (ONOE) could become a victim of such a situation.&nbsp;</p><p>There could be competing views on the need for ONOE and its impact on polity in a federal democracy like India. But in the absence of sagacity and pragmatism, hyperbole, rhetoric and polemics have ended up destroying both the discourse and the process of legislation for an amendment for simultaneous elections that the NDA regime proposed during the \u201cwashed out\u201d winter session of the Parliament. As expected, the Bill has been referred to a select committee. It is anybody's guess whether the NDA regime will manage to cobble together a two-thirds majority of \u201cpresent\u201d members to be able to pass the Bill.</p><h2><strong>No Time To Govern</strong></h2><p>However, what about the idea of ONOE? On the face of it, there is some merit to the argument in favour of simultaneous elections. There can be no dispute that the political landscape in India is littered with elections the way the Indian calendar is littered with festivals. Look at what has happened over the last year. There were elections to state assemblies in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Soon after that came the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. When political parties, voters and analysts had barely even begun to digest the import of the verdict, assembly elections became due in Haryana and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (after a gap of 10 years). Even before one could delve deeper into the surprise verdicts, elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand were announced. Just as India starts the new year in 2025, elections to the Delhi assembly will be announced. For Indian voters, pollsters, pundits and assorted debaters alike, the year 2025 will be a relatively dull year as only Bihar will go for elections towards the end of the year. But 2026 will see a flurry, with Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam being the major states that will elect new governments. That will be followed in 2027 by shenanigans in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and some others. There will be another series of assembly elections soon after, and then the 2029 Lok Sabha elections will be due before you can pause to take a breath.</p><p>This is clearly not a healthy situation. National-level parties are perpetually in campaign mode because of this never-ending stream of assembly elections. Purely regional parties don't suffer as much as their footprint normally doesn't extend beyond one state. For instance, Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK chief M. K. Stalin and his son-cum-inheritor Udaynidhi Stalin couldn't care much about elections to West Bengal and Assam, which will be held along with Tamil Nadu in 2026. Perhaps even neighbouring Kerala won't be too important for them.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Case For ONOE</strong></h2><p>Yet, there is an impact on governance because elections mean the Model Code of Conduct, a period when policy decisions are paralysed. In a rapidly changing and evolving geopolitical scenario, this doesn't augur well. Since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leads the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the centre, it cannot announce significant policy decisions in 2026 as they could impact voter behaviour in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam. Any window for serious governance and policymaking would be brief because soon it would be time for elections in Uttar Pradesh et al. Besides, there is the issue of costs, the diversion of human and other resources for the conduct of elections, and the question of organising paramilitary forces every few months.&nbsp;</p><p>These factors do suggest that there is a case for simultaneous elections. On the other hand, what could be the reasons that present a case against it? There are some who argue that a single burst of elections to Parliament and all the state assemblies would give an unfair advantage to resource-rich national parties like the BJP, which would outgun and steamroll opponents who can't match its resources, particularly at the regional level. That's simply not true. The year 1967 was the last time India saw simultaneous polls. Even then, while Indira Gandhi led the Congress to a victory in the Lok Sabha, she lost about 10 states to various opposition groups and alliances. Even in contemporary times, the Narendra Modi-led BJP has won massive victories in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections, to be followed soon by massive victories for the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP in assembly elections. The Indian voter is astute and knows how to distinguish between national and local issues. In any case, many regional parties have publicly announced their support for ONOE.</p><h2><strong>Give And Take</strong></h2><p>The problem is not the idea but the deeply divisive and polarised nature of Indian politics. The Janata Dal (United) (JD-U), an NDA ally, is in favour of simultaneous polls. On the other hand, its rival, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which is also largely confined to Bihar, is fiercely opposed to it. Both support and opposition don't seem to stem from merits but from political divide and a deep mistrust. The manner in which the recent winter session of the Parliament was conducted reveals how bitter and deep this gulf is. In such a situation, it would take an extraordinary level of pragmatic give-and-take politics to make ONOE a reality.&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible, the contentious GST Bill was passed in 2017 despite deep divisions. But for the sake of pragmatism, the authors would suggest two solutions. First, start with One Nation, Two Elections, wherein assembly elections are divided into two separate bunches. Second, and more important, the government should seriously consider a law that would enable referendums in India, as held in other major democracies. Why not have a national vote where citizens deliver a verdict on ONOE and other major issues?</p><p><em>(Yashwant Deshmukh is the Founder &amp; Editor-in-Chief of CVoter Foundation and Sutanu Guru is Executive Director)</em></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author</strong></p>"

        "content": "<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\"><div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\"></div></div><p>The four days dedicated by Parliament to deliberate on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution of India culminated in a heated debate over Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly. Both sides of the aisle sought to claim the legacy of Ambedkar.</p><p>A statement by Home Minister Amit Shah, which was intended to ridicule the Opposition's claim to represent Ambedkar's legacy, did not provoke a response in the House but led to an unprecedented uproar outside the next day.</p><p>A 12-second clip of the minister's speech was widely circulated on social media, with suggestions that he had been unfair to Ambedkar's memory. In fairness, it must be asked why the Opposition did not protest in the Rajya Sabha as the minister spoke. Amit Shah maintains that his speech was clipped out of context to create controversy.</p><p>The Opposition, which seemed disorganised during the session, with allies distancing themselves from Congress slogans, suddenly found a cause to rally around. The shameful events on the penultimate day of the winter session may well be the darkest episode in our constitutional history. MPs are elected to debate issues in Parliament, not to spar like gladiators at its gates.</p><p>During the Winter Session, the Lok Sabha worked for just 57% of the time, while the Rajya Sabha functioned for only 43%. Very little productive work is being done in Parliament.</p><p>Instead of focusing on the floor of the House, we now witness hyperactivity at the gates. Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi holds mock media interviews, and Opposition MPs climb the ramparts of the new Parliament building. Despite the Lok Sabha Speaker's direction that no demonstrations be held at the gates, ruling party MPs block the entrances to counter the Opposition protests.</p><p>Allegations of fisticuffs being exchanged and two MPs being injured have emerged. The Delhi Police's Crime Branch has been tasked with investigating the matter. Politicians' activities on Parliament premises are now subject to a criminal probe\u2014an unprecedented situation in the annals of parliamentary democracy.</p><p>Let us now come back to the Ambedkar legacy and who has claims over it.</p><p>When the Constituent Assembly was formed in 1946, Dr. Ambedkar faced strong opposition to his candidacy from Congress stalwarts, including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. As a result, he failed to get elected from his then home state of Bombay.</p><p>Some Congress leaders in Bombay were reportedly of the view that \u201capart from the doors, the windows of the Constituent Assembly were closed to Bhimrao Ambedkar.\u201d The reason for their opposition stemmed from Ambedkar's differences with Mahatma Gandhi, which led to his 1933 fast in Yerwada Jail and the subsequent signing of the Poona Pact. In 1936, Ambedkar had also formed the Indian Labour Party, which contested elections against Congress in provincial elections.</p><p>Later, Ambedkar formed the Scheduled Castes Federation (SCF), which came to his aid in 1946, ensuring his election to the Constituent Assembly from the Jessore-Khulna constituency in undivided Bengal. Jogendra Nath Mandal, a Namosudra SCF legislator, helped secure Ambedkar's election through the Bengal Legislature. Ambedkar won with the highest votes, with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's brother, Sarat Chandra Bose, securing one vote fewer. Other prominent figures, including Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Frank Anthony, were also elected alongside Ambedkar.</p><p>The partition of 1947 saw Jessore-Khulna going to the East Bengal Province of the Dominion of Pakistan. The member elected from Jessore-Khulna was to be included in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly in Karachi.</p><p>Since his election in 1946, Ambedkar had made significant contributions to the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of undivided India. Rajendra Prasad thus sent a request to B.G. Kher, the then Premier (as Chief Ministers were called at the time) of Bombay, asking him to ensure Ambedkar's election to the Constituent Assembly of India.</p><p>\u201cI am anxious that he should attend the next session of the Constituent Assembly, commencing from the 14th of July 1947, and it is therefore necessary that he should be elected immediately,\u201d Rajendra Prasad wrote to Kher.</p><p>Kher set aside his opposition, which had previously forced Ambedkar to seek election from Bengal. He arranged for the member from Poona (Pune), Mukund Ramrao Jayakar, to resign. The resulting by-election was won by Ambedkar, while Jayakar was appointed a minister in the Bombay government.<br />Ambedkar's Bengal connection came to light during the Winter Session of 2015 when, at the instance of Narendra Modi, Constitution Day was first observed on November 26. Trinamool Congress floor leader and veteran parliamentarian Sudip Bandopadhyay mentioned it in his tribute. A controversy followed, with BJP MP from West Bengal's Darjeeling seat, Surinder Ahluwalia, disputing the claim and asserting that Ambedkar was elected from Bombay State. Both MPs were right. &nbsp;Ambedkar, while presiding over the Drafting Committee (which had 10 members, with B.N. Rau writing the document), was indeed a member from Bombay when the Constitution was adopted.</p><p>Ambedkar's differences with Congress, which led to his resignation from Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet in 1951 and his subsequent unsuccessful bids to enter the Lok Sabha from Bombay North-Central (in the first general election of 1952) and from Bhandara (in a 1954 by-election), are often highlighted. It is worth noting that, despite contesting against Congress on both occasions, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1952 as a member of the Scheduled Castes Federation (SCF). This was made possible because the Congress did not oppose his Rajya Sabha nomination.</p><p>While the spotlight is on Ambedkar, it is worthwhile to recall the comment he made about his role: \u201cThe Hindus wanted the Vedas, and they sent for (Ved) Vyasa, who was not a caste Hindu. The Hindus wanted the epic Ramayana and they sent for Valmiki, who was an untouchable. The Hindus want a constitution, and they have sent for me.\u201d</p><p>While the legacy of Bhimrao Ambedkar is being debated, it is important to recognise that not all in Congress were opposed to him. He had been both an opponent and an ally of the party.</p><p>Three days before the Constitution was formally adopted on November 26, 1949, the Organiser, in its November 23, 1949 edition, carried an article by the then RSS Sarsanghchalak lamenting that \u201cunique constitutional developments in ancient Bharat\u201d had been glossed over.</p><p>Ambedkar's Constitution of India is a product of competing ideas that were incorporated into a historic text. The behaviour of current MPs, both inside the House and outside, stands in stark contrast to Ambedkarite thought, whose legacy everyone seems eager to usurp.</p><p><em>(Shubhabrata Bhattacharya is a retired editor and a public affairs commentator)</em></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author</strong></p>"

        "content": "<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\"><div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\"><img alt=\"Latest and Breaking News on NDTV\" id=\"story_image_main\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/mrn1q7co_al-jolani_625x300_24_December_24.jpg\" title=\"Latest and Breaking News on NDTV\" /></div></div><p>Way back on December 6, 1993, <em>The Independent</em>, a British newspaper, published a feature article written by the late Robert Fisk, a journalist of considerable repute and whom I admired immensely. The piece, titled \u2018Anti-Soviet Warrior Puts His Army On The Road To Peace', was a soft-focus portrait of Osama bin Laden, at the time a seemingly benign figure dabbling in Sudanese infrastructure projects and agricultural ventures. According to the article, bin Laden was just another philanthropic \u201cSaudi businessman\u201d, orchestrating road-building campaigns and offering Sudanese children something to dance about. \"Chadored children danced in front of him (bin Laden), and preachers acknowledged his wisdom,\" the article cooed.&nbsp;</p><p>Little did the veteran journalist know that this \u201cmountain warrior of mujahideen legend\u201d, as he so poetically was described in the piece, was quietly laying the groundwork for a global jihadist empire. Bin Laden, we were assured, was just a humble construction engineer who didn't have time for training camps because he was too busy building roads. That statement, in hindsight, has haunted many since September 11, 2001.</p><h2><strong>US Effort To 'Rehabilitate' al-Jolani&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu today. The West's current blindspot is Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani\u2014or, as he prefers to be known during his ongoing image makeover, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Until the fall of the Assad regime early this month, al-Jolani was referred to in the Western media and governments by his earlier name.</p><p>That's not enough. On Friday, the US government quietly binned its $10 million bounty for al-Jolani. Yes, the same al-Jolani who, not too long ago, topped Washington's \"Most Wanted Terrorists\" list. Now, he is apparently rebranded as America's new favourite bilateral dialogue partner in Syria. The Assistant Secretary of State, Barbara Leaf, gushed that her meeting with al-Jolani (She said al-Sharaa) was \u201cvery productive\u201d,praising his \"pragmatism\u201d.</p><p>The US delegation touched down in Damascus barely two weeks after al-Jolani's HTS and allies toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime. And yet, officially, HTS remains listed as a terrorist organisation by the same State Department that's now discussing \u201ctransition principles\u201d with its representatives. Going by how things are, that tag may also be lifted soon.</p><p>From $10 million bounties to \"productive discussions\"\u2014al-Jolani's journey has been fascinating. But what's been even more telling is the trajectory of US foreign policy. Lessons from the past, tragically, are being ignored. As was the case with bin Laden in 1993, al-Jolani is now in the throes of a remarkable image overhaul. Once the Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist warlord at the helm of Jabhat al-Nusra, he is being rebranded in glowing profiles as a \u201crebel politician\u201d and a \u201cpragmatic\u201d administrator of Idlib, which he ruled after capturing it from the Assad government in 2015.</p><h2><strong>A 'Misunderstood Revolutionary'?</strong></h2><p>Western media, some sections of it anyway, seem intent on presenting al-Jolani as a misunderstood revolutionary rather than a man with blood on his hands and a vision of governance lifted straight from medieval textbooks. His abandonment of \u201ctraditional jihadist militant attire\u201d in favour of a \u201cWestern-style wardrobe\u201d is heralded as a sign of reform. His carefully curated media appearances, designed to appeal to both international audiences and Syrian locals, are being lapped up readily with barely a question posed His Salafi jihadist ideology is being swept under the carpet.</p><p>Today, we tacitly applaud al-Jolani's \u2018pragmatic' governance while ignoring the well-documented human rights abuses, forced conscriptions and draconian Sharia-based judicial system under HTS rule. No one seems to want to ask al-Jolani whether his vision for Syria is a Taliban-style emirate or whether his Sharia courts will keep their doors open for public executions.</p><p>Do you remember the \"good Taliban vs bad Taliban\" narrative put forward by the West? The same principle appears to be applied to HTS. &nbsp;I do not think it's journalistic naivete. I believe it's part of a broader Western policy playbook. The West, in its perpetual search for \u201clesser evils\u201d in messy conflicts in the Middle East, seems to think the rehabilitation of HTS is a masterstroke. After all, with the memory of Bashar al-Assad's brutal dictatorship still fresh, the argument goes, isn't al-Jolani's HTS the lesser of two evils? The US government appears to have accepted this narrative, framing HTS as a necessary counterweight to more extreme groups like ISIS. But this logic hinges on an artfully calibrated campaign to demonise Assad\u2014admittedly no hard task\u2014while subtly legitimising HTS as the only viable alternative.</p><h2><strong>Vilifying The Asad Regime&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The Assad family regime's 54-year iron-fisted rule has undoubtedly been a catalogue of atrocities. But must the demonisation of one devil necessitate the anointing of another? This is where the US's ill-considered foreign policy diverges sharply from the Global South's approach, which might best be described as nuanced cynicism. Unlike Western diplomats and media outlets, who seem intent on polishing the HTS's reputation, nations in the Global South understand that rehabilitating one group doesn't erase its sins.</p><p>Al-Jolani's PR offensive, with the West's backing, is now in full swing. He's meeting Western journalists, giving interviews and rebranding himself as a strongman with a softer side. The questions he's asked\u2014say, whether he intends to implement a Taliban-style rule, or his stance on alcohol\u2014barely scratch the surface. They are rarely followed by tough, unrelenting supplementaries. He is, quite literally, getting off the hook.</p><p>This isn't rehabilitation\u2014it's a whitewash. And the West's eager complicity in al-Jolani's makeover echoes the same naivet\u00e9 that greeted bin Laden's road-building in Sudan. Because, as history tells us, today's \u201crebel politician\u201d in a blazer could be tomorrow's jihadist mastermind.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>HTS And Its Ideology</strong></h2><p>Syria and Iraq's Islamist organisations operate on a spectrum of jihadist ideologies, each differing in intensity and focus. The HTS, originally branching out from al-Qaeda in Iraq, adheres to a Salafi-jihadist ideology. Unlike some movements focused on reforming Islam internally through Wahhabi doctrines of theology and law\u2014without advocating global jihad\u2014Salafism encompasses a range of beliefs. While many Salafists emphasise personal piety, its extremist adherents push for militant jihad, creating ideological breeding grounds for groups like ISIS.</p><p>The dreaded ISIS ideology, widely condemned by Islamic scholars as un-Islamic, represents an unrestrained offshoot of Salafi-jihadism. It is characterised by hyper-violence, relentless takfir (excommunication) and an obsessive pursuit of a global caliphate. The HTS, despite its extremist roots, has marked ideological and operational differences from ISIS, rejecting the latter's brutality and apocalyptic vision. Yet, history has shown that individuals often cross ideological lines, with jihadists embracing ISIS's extremism or defecting back to milder forms of Salafi-jihadism. The ideological waters remain dangerously fluid.</p><h2><strong>From Guerilla Fighting To Nobel</strong></h2><p>Of course, supporters of the US efforts of legitimising the HTS can turn around and argue that history is littered with figures who made the improbable leap from pariah to politician, from extremist to statesman. Yasser Arafat, once the embodiment of armed Palestinian resistance, spent decades as a declared terrorist in Western eyes. Yet, by the 1990s, the same man was signing peace accords on the White House lawn, shaking hands with Israeli leaders and earning a Nobel Peace Prize. His transition from a militant leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to becoming the head of the Palestinian Authority demonstrated how the once-unthinkable can become a geopolitical necessity. Arafat's pragmatism\u2014whether genuine or opportunistic\u2014enabled him to shift from guerrilla warfare to diplomacy.</p><p>Similarly, Israel's early leaders, such as Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, followed similar patterns. Begin, who led the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group responsible for the controversial bombing of the King David Hotel in 1946, eventually became Israel's prime minister and a Nobel laureate for his peace efforts with Egypt. Shamir, a member of the Stern Gang, which was involved in targeted assassinations, later led Israel as a statesman. Their transitions weren't merely personal but reflected broader political realities: the West and regional actors, recognising the inevitability of their leadership, were forced to recalibrate their stances.</p><h2><strong>Al-Jolani Deserves A Chance, But...</strong></h2><p>al-Jolani, with all the shadows of his murky past, certainly deserves the opportunity to prove he can change\u2014just as Arafat and Begin were granted theirs. The choice, however, lies entirely with him. Will he reinvent himself as they did, transforming from a militant leader into a statesman who earns a place at the very negotiation tables he once sought to dismantle? Or will he follow the path of Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, under whom he once served\u2014a path that inevitably leads to isolation, destruction, and infamy?</p><p>The key distinction between warlords-turned-politicians and al-Jolani, who aspires to make that leap, lies in his steadfast adherence to an extremist religious ideology\u2014one he has yet to publicly renounce. While engaging with Al-Jolani, we cannot ignore the ideological undercurrents driving him and his movement. Vigilance is crucial to ensure that his new administration, now forming with US backing, doesn't rekindle ties with groups like Al-Qaeda. Should that happen, the repercussions could ripple far beyond Syria, unleashing devastating global consequences.</p><p><em>(Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media)</em></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author</strong></p>"

This departure undermines the principles of fairness and impartiality, which are critical to the credibility of the Selection Committee. Instead of fostering deliberation and ensuring a collective decision, the Committee relied on its numerical majority to finalise the names, disregarding the legitimate concerns and perspectives raised during the meeting,\" they said in the dissent note.</p><p>The Opposition leaders said the NHRC is a vital statutory body tasked with safeguarding the fundamental human rights of all citizens, particularly those from marginalised sections of society. \"Its ability to fulfil this mandate depends significantly on the inclusiveness and representativeness of its composition. A diverse leadership ensures that the NHRC remains sensitive to the unique challenges faced by various communities, especially those most vulnerable to human rights violations,\" they said.</p><p>The Congress leaders had proposed the names of former Supreme Court judges, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice KM Joseph for the chairperson's post, \"keeping in mind both merit and the need for inclusivity\".</p><p>\"Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, a distinguished jurist from the minority Parsi community, is renowned for his intellectual depth and unwavering commitment to constitutional values.

Their inclusion would contribute to the NHRC's effectiveness and its commitment to diversity,\" the dissent note said.</p><p>\"Thirdly, while merit is undeniably the primary criterion, maintaining a balance that reflects the regional, caste, community, and religious diversity of the nation is equally important. This balance ensures that the NHRC operates with an inclusive perspective, sensitive to the lived experiences of all sections of society. By neglecting this critical principle, the Committee risks eroding public trust in this esteemed institution,\" it added.&nbsp;The Congress leaders flagged the \"dismissive approach\" adopted by the majority of the Selection Committee and termed it \"deeply regrettable\". \"The NHRC's credibility and effectiveness depend on its ability to embody the diversity and inclusiveness that define India's constitutional ethos. The names we proposed reflect this spirit and align with the foundational principles of the Commission. Their exclusion raises significant concerns about the impartiality and fairness of the selection process,\" they said.</p><p>While Justice Ramasubramanian was named NHRC chairperson, Priyank Kanoongo and Dr Justice Bidyut Ranjan Sarangi have been appointed members of the rights panel.&nbsp;While Mr Kanoongo is the former chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Justice Sarangi is the former Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court.</p>"

Indeed, in the first study, 88% of the ten-month-olds \u2013 and 100% of the six-month-olds \u2013 chose to reach for the helper.</p><figure><figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Kiley Hamlin explains the helper-hinderer experiment.</span></figcaption></figure><p>But psychology, and developmental psychology, in particular, is <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/replication-crisis\">no stranger to replicability concerns</a> (when it is difficult or impossible to reproduce the results of a scientific study). After all, the original study sampled only a few dozen infants.</p><p>This isn't the fault of the researchers; it's just really hard to collect data from babies. But what if it was possible to run the same study again \u2014 with say, hundreds or even thousands of babies? Would researchers find the same result?</p><p>This is the chief aim of ManyBabies, a consortium of developmental psychologists spread around the world. By combining resources across individual research labs, ManyBabies can robustly test findings in developmental science, like Hamlin's original \u201chelper-hinderer\u201d effect. And as of last month, the results are in.</p><p>With a final sample of 567 babies, tested in 37 research labs across five continents, babies did not show evidence of an early-emerging moral sense. Across the ages tested, babies showed no preference for the helpful character.</p><h2>Blank slate?</h2><p>John Locke, an English philosopher <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/\">argued</a> that the human mind is a \u201ctabula rasa\u201d or \u201cblank slate\u201d. Everything that we, as humans, know comes from our experiences in the world. So should people take the most recent ManyBabies result as evidence of this? My answer, however underwhelming, is \u201cperhaps\u201d.</p><p>This is not the first attempted replication of the helper-hinderer effect (nor is it the first \u201cfailure to replicate\u201d). In fact, there have been a <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-33347-001.html\">number of successful replications</a>. It can be hard to know what underlies differences in results. For example, a <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4310275/\">previous \u201cfailure\u201d</a> seemed to come from the characters' \u201cgoogly eyes\u201d not being oriented the right way.</p><p>The ManyBabies experiment also had an important change in how the \u201cshow\u201d was presented to infants. Rather than a puppet show performed live to baby participants, researchers instead presented a video with digital versions of the characters. This approach has its strengths. For example, ensuring that the exact same presentation occurs across every trial, in every lab. But it could also shift how babies engage with the show and its characters.</p><p>I appreciated the <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mcxfrank.bsky.social/post/3lcgtoas5gs2w\">recent remarks</a> made by Michael Frank, founder of the ManyBabies consortium, on social network BlueSky: \u201cSome people will jump to the interpretation that [the results of ManyBabies] shows that the original finding was incorrect (and hence that the other replications were incorrect as well, and the earlier non-replications were right). This [is] one possibility \u2013 but we shouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Rather, we can take this finding for exactly what it is: a well-executed large investigation (senior-authored by Kiley Hamlin herself) of the hypothesis that infants prefer helpers over hinderers. In this instance, the hypothesis was not supported.</p><p>This could be because, underneath it all, Locke was right. Perhaps the babies tested hadn't had enough time in the world to learn \u201cright from wrong\u201d, so they wouldn't make any distinction between a helpful character and a harmful one. Or perhaps there's something more complicated going on. Only more science, with many, many more babies, will tell us.</p><p>At the very least, a question mark now hangs over one of the most famous experiments in developmental psychology.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.
